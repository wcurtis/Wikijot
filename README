Welcome to Wikijot.

I jot a ton of ideas, notes, and other information in my personal wiki. This app will be used for quickly jotting notes down from my Android device which saves to my wiki.

I know what you're thinking.. "Aren't there hundreds of other note taking apps that work wonders?". And to that I say yes, I'm aware. But none that I've used have given me the efficiency of being able to start typing the second I open the app, and simply close the app once I'm done without saving. These are the two goals of this project.

Goals
* One tap on the app icon and you're ready to take notes
* Close the app, and your notes are added to your wiki

Could this be the fastest way to take notes? We'll see!
